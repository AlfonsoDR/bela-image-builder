Unless the boot button on the bbb is pushed, the first-stage bootloader MLO is loaded from the emmc. It loads the second-stage bootloader, u-boot.img, also from the emmc. 

On bbbs with newer images or with Bela's custom bootloaders flashed to their emmcs, u-boot loads uEnv.txt from the SD card's BELABOOT FAT32 partition and executes uenvcmd. This loads am335x-bone-bela.dtb from BELABOOT and the kernel from /boot from the rootfs partition. It then boots the kernel.

On bbbs with older images on their emmcs, the uEnv.txt either doesn't get loaded, or uenvcmd does not get executed, so they don't boot.

Bela's custom bootloaders which can be found in this folder are 3-4 seconds faster than the defaults. They can be flashed onto the emmc using the script /opt/Bela/bela_bootloader.sh.

The uEnv.txt on the BELABOOT partition can be edited to change the dtb, kernel, kernel command line, or bootloader boot command.
